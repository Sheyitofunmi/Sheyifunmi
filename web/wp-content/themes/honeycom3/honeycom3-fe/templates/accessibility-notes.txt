// Accessibility guidelines & tips

Styling
  - If you use display: none or visibility: hidden to hide any content on initial page load,
    make sure to also set the 'aria-live' attribute to make sure screenreaders are also notified
    of any changes when the content becomes visible

Links
  - always make link text relevant and descriptive
  - if a link wraps an image with alt text, the alt text of the image will act as the link
    description for screen readers
  - avoid using link title attributes - they do not get read aloud by screen readers and can cause
    confusing/lengthy tooltips

Content
  - Always provide an alt tag for images - this is what screenreaders will read for context - it's
    important for SEO too
  - Specify font size in CSS, don't use a heading to make text larger - check content input by client to make sure that headings aren't used inappropriately
